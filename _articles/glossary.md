Government is filled with acronyms and abbreviations, here are some common
ones and what they mean.

### IAA

we have with other agencies that let them use login.gov as partners/clients.

### IdV

This is the process we go through to verify user's identities. We use the terms proofing and identity verification interchangeably. We follow the [NIST 800-63-3][nist-800-63-3] guidelines for enrollment and identity proofing.
