For contractors, login.gov has a default 45 hour cap on hours worked per week.

### Overtime Requests

If a contractor feels they will be working over 45hour cap due to an incident, application launch or overloaded sprint, they should email their Product Lead and team Product Owner for approval prior to going over the weekly hour cap. 
 
 Notification exceptions: if an incident occurs on a Friday or weekend, email requests can be sent by EOD the following Monday.
